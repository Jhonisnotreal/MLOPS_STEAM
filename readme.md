# Machine Learning Operations (MLOPS)

## Description

This project focuses on the development of a recommendation system for STEAM, a video game digital distribution service and storefront developed by Valve Corporation. In this project, I assumed the role of a Machine Learning Operations Engineer. During the process, I implemented an ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) for the data and conducted an EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis). Additionally, an API was developed to analyze sentiments in user comments. The model created is capable of recommending games to users, thereby enhancing their overall experience.




## Conclusion

I'm glad to have made this project possible, navigating through processes like ETL and EDA, understanding and applying concepts from Machine Learning, and solving real-world problems!
