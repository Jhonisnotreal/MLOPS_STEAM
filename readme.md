# Machine Learning Operations (MLOPS)

## Description

This project focuses on the development of a recommendation system for STEAM, a video game digital distribution service and storefront developed by Valve Corporation. In this project, I assumed the role of a Machine Learning Operations Engineer. During the process, I implemented an ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) for the data and conducted an EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis). Additionally, an API was developed to analyze sentiments in user comments. The model created is capable of recommending games to users, thereby enhancing their overall experience.

## Data

We have steam_games.json.gz, user_reviews.json.gz, and user_items.json.gz files. The first file (steam_games.json.gz) contains information about games such as its title, price, technical features, etc. user_reviews.json.gz contains comments from users and its recommendation. And finally, user_items.json.gz contains time played by the user.

## Objective
We want to simulate the workflow and environment of a Data Scientist and a Data Engineer, cleaning and extracting data to implement machine learning models, such as analyzing sentiments in user comments and recommending games.

## Conclusion

I'm glad to have made this project possible, navigating through processes like ETL and EDA, understanding and applying concepts from Machine Learning, and solving real-world problems!
